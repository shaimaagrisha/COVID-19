1. Introduction:
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the coronavirus family that is usually common in animals. COVID-19 affects the respiratory and cause symptoms such as: cough, fever, shortness of breath, muscle aches, sore throat, unexplained loss of taste or smell, diarrhea and headache. COVID-19 can be severe, and some cases have caused death. There are 4,013,728 confirmed cases and 278,993 Confirme deaths of COVID-19

2. Project objectives
1.Determine the effective factors/features on spreading Coronavirus. 2.Detect the factor(s) that may lead to increase the fatality rate. 3.Build a classifier that can estimate the probability of being infected.

3. Methodolgy:
Data cleaning, prepration, statistical analysis metrics such as: mean, median, and correlation.The analysis include graphs; histograms, box plots, barplot, and time series plot to make better view.Backward selection method to choose the most effective features indicated using the changes in model performance.Random Forest algorithm to detect the most important features in relation with the infection and deaths. and finally isNeural Network Model.
